## Description
This project is a simple number guessing game to occupy you during your programming sessions,
while waiting for some big program to compile, a linux package to install, or an update to download !

## Use and rules
- When launching the script, the first argument will be the player's lifes, the second one will
be the number selection seed (from 0 to arg2); `./shell_guess.sh` `lives` `seed` .
- Launching the script without arguments wil result in default settings (5 lives, from 0 to 10 selection).
- Guessing the number correctly from the first try will terminate the game as a win.
- Guessing the number incorrectly will remove a life.
- Guessing the number correctly will grant an additional life.
- Losing all lifes will terminate the game as a loss.
- Guessing the number correctly multiple times in a row will put you on a streak.
